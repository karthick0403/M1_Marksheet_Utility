# PROJECT TITLE :MARKSHEET CREATING SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT:

       The Marksheet Generator is flexible for generating progress mark sheet of students. This system is mainly based in the database technology and the credit based grading system (CBGS). The system is targeted to small enterprises, schools, colleges and universities. It can produce sophisticated ready-touse mark sheet, which could be created and will be ready to print. The development of a marksheet and gadget sheet is focusing at describing tables with columns/rows and subcolumn sub-rows, rules of data selection and summarizing for report, particular table or column/row, and formatting the report in destination document. The adjustable data interface will be popular data sources (SQL Server) and report destinations (PDF file). Marksheet generation system can be used in universities to automate the distribution of digitally verifiable mark-sheets of students. The system accesses the students’ exam information from the university database and generates the gadget-sheet Gadget sheet keeps the track of student information in properly listed manner. The project aims at developing a marksheet generation system which can be used in universities to automate the distribution of digitally verifiable student result mark sheets. The system accesses the students’ results information from the institute student database and generates the mark sheets in Portable Document Format which is tamper proof which provides the authenticity of the document. Authenticity of the document can also be verified easily.
       
## INTRODUCTION:
 
         The marksheet generator is a system which allows the digital automation of the mark-sheets of the students. The system will generate the mark-sheets in Portable Document Format which is globally accepted format for files. The PDF document is very difficult to modify and requires the use of the complex software. To simply put, system is to provide the mark-sheet for credits based grading system in user friendly and secure manner. The credits based grading system enables a much require shift in focus from teacher-centric to learner-centric education. It also focuses on the continuous evaluation which will enhance the quality of education. It is very much essential to implement credits based grading system based higher education worldwide. The efficiency of the system would increase in a leap and bounds considering the fact that system will be automated & would be corruption free. Along with the above mentioned privileges, it also ensures security &spreads the awareness about the university rules and regulation.
